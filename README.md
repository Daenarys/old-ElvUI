Latest ElvUI but with some custom changes, mostly reverts, of what I liked from old ElvUI versions.
The current ElvUI devs are making changes that are completely unnecessary and imo are making it worse.

Changes so far:

- Reverted the LFG role icons to the old ones and adjusted the checkbox position/backdrop
- Reverted the Adventure Guide to the Legion version, parchment was enabled by default back then and the buttons on the right looked much cleaner. 
- Reverted the SpecSwitch and Durability datatexts
- Reverted Chat Tab stuff
