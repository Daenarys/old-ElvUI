# old-ElvUI
Latest ElvUI for Shadowlands but with alot of changes reverted that made it look worse.

Changes so far:

- Reverted the Adventure Guide to the pre 2019 version which had the Overview, Loot, Abilties and Model tabs on the right side with a image and it had alot of parchment removed by default so it looks alot cleaner than the current ElvUI
- Reverted the new Role Icons in Looking For Group, they were to big and ugly
- Reverted Spec and Durability datatexts
- Reverted Chat Tab height and moved text position to the left
